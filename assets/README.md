# Assets Directory

Place your app icon files here:

- **icon.png** - Main icon file (512x512 or larger, PNG format) - Used for Linux and as fallback
- **icon.icns** - macOS icon bundle - Used when building for macOS
- **icon.ico** - Windows icon file - Used when building for Windows

The icon should match your app branding: "Black Angus EPD Color Coder" with the Black Angus bull head and color-coded spreadsheet background.

If you have the icon file ready, please:
1. Copy it to this directory as `icon.png`
2. For production builds, also create `icon.icns` (macOS) and `icon.ico` (Windows) if needed

The app will automatically use the icon if it's present in this directory.
