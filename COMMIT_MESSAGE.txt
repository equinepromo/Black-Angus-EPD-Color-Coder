feat: Add scoring to Animal Entry tab, category filtering, and UI improvements

Animal Entry Tab Scoring:
- Added scoring functionality to Animal Entry tab using same formula as mating scoring
- Added Score column to results table with default sort by score (descending)
- Scores calculated using emphasis-based weighting, penalties, and gate logic
- Maintains existing table sorting functionality

Code Refactoring:
- Extracted shared scoring function `scoreEpdValues()` in mating-ranker.js
- Refactored `evaluateMating()` to use shared scoring function
- Added IPC handler `score-animal` for scoring individual animals
- Removed ~300 lines of duplicated scoring code from renderer
- Improved code maintainability and consistency (DRY principle)

All Matings Category Filtering:
- Added category selectors for sires and cows in All Matings mode
- Defaults to "All" categories (backward compatible)
- Filters animals by selected category before sex filtering
- Updated `getCachedAnimalsWithData()` to include category in returned data

UI Improvements:
- Removed max-width constraint on main container to support ultra-wide monitors
- Improved gate traits checkbox layout (removed scrollable container, full-width grid)
- Gate traits now display in responsive grid that adapts to screen width
- Added Excel export button to All Matings results
- Excel export includes score, gate status, and all mating data

Technical Changes:
- Enhanced main/cache-util.js: Include category in animal data objects
- Enhanced main/main.js: Added category filtering to rank-all-matings handler
- Enhanced main/mating-ranker.js: Extracted scoreEpdValues() shared function
- Enhanced preload.js: Added scoreAnimal() IPC API
- Enhanced renderer/renderer.js: Scoring, category filtering, Excel export
- Enhanced renderer/index.html: Category selectors, improved gate traits UI
- Enhanced renderer/styles.css: Removed container max-width constraint
